# VMWBackup
BASH script for automated (cron'd) VMware Workstation backup on Linux

This first iteration is incomplete and has only ever been tested against a single system in a very specific environment.  You don't want anything to do with this script at this time.  No, really.  I promise.  Go watch a movie.  Or order a pizza.  Or take your dog for a walk.  Go do anything other than download this script.  And for the love of God, don't try to use it!

If you use this script, you're on your own.

I offer no support and probably won't even acknowledge your email message(s) let alone respond.

You have been warned:  do not use this script!
